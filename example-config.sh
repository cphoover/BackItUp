# A special care must be taken when specifying source path. Rsync will operate
# fundamentally different when trainling slash (/) is and isnâ€™t used.
# In other words this
# rsync /home/libor/Documents /mnt/backup
# very different from
# rsync /home/libor/Documents/ /mnt/backup
#
# If you omit traling slash, rsync will create last folder of path before actual 
# content copying. But if you append traling slash to source, rsync will skip
# that folder and copy subfolders and files of that folder directly to target.
# This is generally what we want
# e.g here the contents of vhosts will be copied
# REMOTE_LOCATION="/var/www/vhosts/"
# DESTINATION="./vhosts/"
# whereas here
# REMOTE_LOCATION="/var/www/vhosts"
# DESTINATION="./vhosts"
# rsync will copy the folder itself and you end up with ./vhosts/vhosts
